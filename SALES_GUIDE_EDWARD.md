2. Month 3: Website live, happy with work → adds SEO (RM1,500/month) = RM2,700 total
3. Month 6: Seeing SEO results → adds social media (RM800/month) = RM3,500 total
4. Month 9: Ready to scale → adds Google Ads (RM1,500/month) = RM5,000 total
5. **Result: Turned RM1,200 client into RM5,000 client over 9 months**

**Example Path 2:**
1. Month 1: Client needs website urgently → sells one-time build (RM6,000 profit)
2. Month 2: Website launches → sells maintenance (RM300/month)
3. Month 3: Happy with website → sells SEO (RM1,500/month) = RM1,800 total
4. Month 6: SEO working → sells Google Ads (RM1,200/month) = RM3,000 total
5. **Result: One-time RM6K + now RM3,000/month recurring**

## 🗣️ Sales Scripts & Pitch Examples

### Opening Pitch (First Call):
*"Thanks for taking my call! I'm Edward from Yokan Digital. We help Malaysian businesses get more customers through better websites, SEO, and digital marketing. What's your biggest challenge right now when it comes to getting customers online?"*

**Then LISTEN. Let them tell you what they need.**

### Discovery Questions:
1. "What's your current website situation?" (Do they have one? Is it working?)
2. "How do most customers find you right now?" (Word of mouth? Google? Social?)
3. "If you could fix ONE thing about your online presence, what would it be?"
4. "What's worked well in the past? What hasn't?"
5. "What's your timeline for getting this done?"
6. "What budget range are you working with?"

### When They Say "Too Expensive":

**Script 1 - Break It Down:**
*"I understand. Let's think about it this way - if we bring you just 2 extra customers per month, what would that be worth to your business? Most of our clients see 5-15 new leads monthly. The service pays for itself."*

**Script 2 - Start Smaller:**
*"No problem! We don't have to do everything at once. What if we started with just [their biggest pain point] - that would be [lower price]. We can add more later once you see results."*

**Script 3 - Payment Plan:**
*"Would it help if we spread the one-time cost over 6 or 12 months? Many clients prefer that."*

### When They Say "We'll Think About It":

**Script 1 - Create Urgency:**
*"Absolutely, take your time. Just so you know, we're booking projects 3-4 weeks out right now. If you want to launch by [their timeline], we'd need to start by [date]. Should I hold a spot for you?"*

**Script 2 - Offer Free Value:**
*"Of course! While you're thinking, can I run a free SEO audit on your site? Takes 30 seconds and shows exactly where you're losing traffic. Then you'll have concrete data to make your decision."*

**Script 3 - Ask What's Holding Them Back:**
*"Makes sense. Can I ask - what are you thinking about specifically? Is it the price, timeline, or something else? Maybe I can address that for you."*

### When They Want to "Shop Around":

**Script:**
*"Smart move! You should compare options. Here's what I'd suggest - ask the other agencies about their process, timelines, and what happens if you're not satisfied. Also ask to see results from similar clients. We're happy to provide references. When you're ready to compare apples to apples, I'm here."*

**Then send them:**
- Our portfolio/case studies
- A simple one-page proposal
- Client testimonials
- Free SEO audit results

### Closing Script:

**When You Sense They're Ready:**
*"It sounds like [solution] is exactly what you need. We can get started this week and have you live by [date]. I'll send over the agreement today - does email work for you?"*

**If They Hesitate:**
*"Tell you what - we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If after the first month you're not happy, we'll refund you. You literally have nothing to lose. Should we get started?"*
