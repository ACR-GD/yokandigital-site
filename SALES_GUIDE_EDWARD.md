## 📦 Our Three Core Packages

### 1️⃣ **Starter Package - RM2,500/month**
**Perfect for:** Small businesses, startups, local shops just getting online

**What You Tell Prospects:**
"This package is designed for businesses that are ready to establish their digital presence without breaking the bank. You'll get a professional website that looks great on all devices, basic SEO to help people find you on Google, and our team monitoring your performance monthly."

**What's Included:**
- **5-Page Professional Website** - Home, About, Services, Contact, plus one custom page (e.g., Gallery, Testimonials)

- Retail shops wanting to showcase products online (without e-commerce yet)

**Objection Handlers:**

- "Can I just use Wix/Squarespace?" → "Absolutely you can! But those platforms limit your SEO potential and growth. We build custom sites that load faster, rank better, and can scale with your business. Plus, you get expert support instead of DIY troubleshooting."

Most clients see ROI within 60-90 days."

- "We tried digital marketing before and it didn't work" → "I hear that a lot. Usually it fails because of inconsistency or poor strategy. With us, you get experts managing this daily, not doing it when you have spare time. We also analyze what went wrong before and fix it."

## 💰 Pricing Philosophy & Flexibility

**Important, Edward:** While we have set packages, you have the freedom to customize based on client needs:

### When to Discount (10-20% off):
- Annual commitments (pay 12 months upfront)
- Multiple locations/franchises (bulk pricing)
- Referrals from existing clients
- Non-profits or social enterprises
- Slow season for us (need to keep team busy)

### When to Charge More (20-50% premium):
- Rush projects (need in 2-4 weeks instead of 8-12 weeks)
- Complex industries (legal, medical, financial with compliance needs)
- High-maintenance clients (lots of revisions, frequent changes)
- Enterprise features (custom integrations, advanced analytics)

### Custom Package Building:
You can mix and match services. For example:
- "Website + SEO only" = RM3,500/month
- "Social Media + Google Ads" = RM4,000/month  
- "Just Google Ads Management" = RM2,000/month + 15% of ad spend

**Rule of Thumb:** Minimum project value should be RM2,500/month or RM8,000 one-time. Anything less doesn't make financial sense for us.
