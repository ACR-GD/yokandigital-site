Act as a world-class High-Ticket Conversion Designer and Frontend Developer.

Create a single-page Sales Landing Page for a "Revenue Engineering Firm" called "Yokan Digital".
The goal is to sell a €20,000 infrastructure implementation to Wealth Management Firms and Staffing Agencies.

**Tech Stack:**
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (use via CDN for simplicity)
- FontAwesome (for icons)
- Google Fonts (Inter for body, JetBrains Mono for headers/tech feel)

**Design Aesthetic:**
- "Dark Mode" Engineering Vibe: Black/Dark Gray backgrounds (#0f172a), White text.
- Accents: "Terminal Green" (#22c55e) or "Cyber Blue" to convey system/tech/money.
- Clean, minimalist, no clutter.
- NO Navigation bar (we don't want them to leave). Just a logo top left.

**Page Structure & Copy (Use this exact text):**

1. **Hero Section (Center aligned):**
   - Badge: "For Staffing Agencies & Wealth Management Firms Only"
   - Headline (H1): "Stop Renting Your Growth. Own The Infrastructure."
   - Subheadline: "We build and install your own Autonomous Client Acquisition System in 21 days. No retainers. Just sovereignty."
   - CTA Button: "Audit Your Infrastructure" (Scrolls to bottom).

2. **The Problem Section (Two columns):**
   - Title: "The Leaking Bucket"
   - Left: "Most agencies sell you leads. But your problem isn't traffic. It's System Failure. You are losing 98% of your opportunities because you rely on manual labor and unconnected tools."
   - Right: [Placeholder for a Chart/Visual showing lost leads]

3. **The Solution: "The Sovereign Growth OS" (Grid of 4 Cards):**
   - Card 1: "The Market Sniper". Icon: Crosshair. Text: "AI-Driven scraping identifies your Total Addressable Market instantly."
   - Card 2: "The Neural Outreach". Icon: Robot/Brain. Text: "n8n + OpenAI workflows that contact decision makers with human relevance at scale."
   - Card 3: "The Invisible Net". Icon: Wifi/Signal. Text: "Retargeting protocols that recapture the 98% who leave your site."
   - Card 4: "The Resurrection Protocol". Icon: Refresh. Text: "We reactivate your dead CRM data and turn it into pipeline."

4. **The "Engineering" Proof (Visual Section):**
   - Headline: "We don't do Magic. We do Engineering."
   - Content: A large placeholder box with a border that says "PLACEHOLDER: Insert n8n Workflow Screenshot Here".
   - Caption: "Complex automations running 24/7, installed directly into your business."

5. **The Offer & Guarantee (Boxed Section):**
   - Title: "One-Time Investment. Lifetime Asset."
   - Price: "€20,000 Implementation Fee."
   - Guarantee: "The 90-Day ROI Guarantee. If the system doesn't generate €20k in pipeline value within 90 days, we work for free until it does."

6. **The Close (Calendly Section):**
   - Headline: "Are you ready to build?"
   - Subhead: "Book your Systems Audit. Serious inquiries only."
   - Content: A div with ID "calendly-embed" (I will add my code later).

**Interactive Elements:**
