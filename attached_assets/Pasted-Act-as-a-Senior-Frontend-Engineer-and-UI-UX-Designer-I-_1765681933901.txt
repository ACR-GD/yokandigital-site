Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer and UI/UX Designer.
I need a complete overhaul of my agency website, "Yokan Digital".
We are pivoting from an interior design marketing agency to a high-end "Revenue Architecture & AI Systems" firm.

Project Goal: Build a high-performance, bilingual (English/French) landing page that sells "Mathematical Truth" and "Autonomous Acquisition Ecosystems".

### 1. TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS
- Framework: React (Vite)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Animations: Framer Motion (for subtle, tech-like reveal effects)
- Icons: Lucide React
- Language Management: i18next (or a custom context hook) for instant EN/FR switching.
- Routing: React Router (if needed, but a single-page scroll layout is preferred).

### 2. DESIGN AESTHETIC (The "Engineer" Vibe)
- Theme: Ultra-Dark Mode. Backgrounds should be nearly black (e.g., #050505 or #0A0A0A).
- Accents: Electric Green (data/success) or Cyber Blue (tech). Use gradients sparingly.
- Typography:
  - Headings: Clean Sans-Serif (Inter or Plus Jakarta Sans).
  - Subtitles/Data points: Monospace font (JetBrains Mono or Roboto Mono) to emphasize the "Code/Math" aspect.
- Visuals: Use grid lines, glowing borders, and abstract data visualization elements (like nodes connecting) instead of stock photos of people.
- Feel: Precise, surgical, industrial, futuristic.

### 3. CORE FEATURES
- **Language Toggle:** A prominent switch in the navbar (EN | FR).
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first engineering.
- **Performance:** High lighthouse score structure.

### 4. CONTENT STRUCTURE (Section by Section)

A. Navbar
- Logo: "Yokan Digital" (Monospace font).
- Links: Methodology, The System, About, Contact.
- CTA Button: "Audit Your Architecture" (Glitch effect on hover).
- Lang Switch: EN/FR.

B. Hero Section
- Headline (EN): "Stop Guessing. Start Engineering Revenue."
- Headline (FR): "Arrêtez de deviner. Ingéniez vos revenus."
- Subheadline: "We build Autonomous Acquisition Ecosystems powered by Data & AI. Replacing marketing magic with mathematical truth."
- Background: Abstract animated data flow or a dark grid.

C. The Problem ("The Chaos")
- Split screen or cards showing: "Vanity Metrics" vs "P&L Reality", "Manual Grunt Work" vs "AI Automation".
- Text: "Traditional agencies sell you hope. We sell you a system."

D. The Solution ("The Machine")
- Feature 3 Pillars:
  1. Data-First Truth (Server-side tracking, Dashboards).
  2. AI Autonomy (n8n/Make workflows, AI Agents).
  3. Scalable Infrastructure (Assets that you own).
- Visual idea: An interactive diagram showing inputs (Data) -> Processing (AI) -> Output (Revenue).

E. Tech Stack Showcase
- Marquee or Grid of logos: Python, SQL, n8n, OpenAI, Google BigQuery, Looker Studio.
- Caption: "Our Weapons of Choice."

F. Founder Section (About)
- Photo placeholder.
- Short bio emphasizing the "Architect" role.
- Quote: "Alone we go faster, together we go further."

G. Footer
- Simple links.
- Socials (LinkedIn).
- Copyright Yokan Digital.

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXECUTION
1. Set up the file structure for a React Vite project.
2. Create a `translations.js` file to handle the EN/FR text objects easily.
3. Build the components using Tailwind for styling.
4. Ensure the design feels "expensive" and "technical".
5. Start by generating the code.
